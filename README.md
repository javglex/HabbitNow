# HabbitNow
Help turn regular tasks into habits

## How?
User can create sticky alarms that go off on a schedule, or intervals. These can be optionally tagged with geofences for location specific activation

Alarms for habits can range from low priority, such as a gentle buzz or sound, to high priority, something that'll really grab your attention.

## What differentiates it from other basic alarms?

User can not only select a time and weekday for the alarm to fire, but a time range can also be defined with intervals.

To silence a habit alarm you can confirm it "On it" or defer it "I'll get the next one". This will create helpful habit stats for users.
